<hr />
<p>When looking at this boxplot, it strikes me that only the playlist
‘dogs’ has a mean around 78 BPM and the other 3 playlists are higher,
even the 2 ‘scientific’ ones. Also striking: the mean (and little SD) in
the ‘Humans’ playlist around 120 BPM. I had expected for both
science-based lists to have the tempo around 60-80 BPM (for
synchronization purposes with humans and dogs rest heartrate) but no
such thing; the dogsscience list even has a higher average than the
regular dogs list.</p>
<p>When listening to the extreme outliers regarding tempo I can safely
assume that the Spotify API isn’t working flawlessly: e.g. the ‘fastest’
song from the dogsscience playlist is “Chorale Prelude No. 5”Ach bleib
bei uns Herr Jesu Christ” in B-Flat Major, BWV 649 (Harp Version)” and
analysed at 200 BPM by Spotify: <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2Chgj5q0NgvBlFvzYVJvUa?si=5592371b98464c2d"
class="uri">https://open.spotify.com/track/2Chgj5q0NgvBlFvzYVJvUa?si=5592371b98464c2d</a></p>
<p>The same applies to the tempo outlier “Leaves” (<a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/60YvUB0fCvLlTDCc99wpgD?si=5f3c0edf44fd4713"
class="uri">https://open.spotify.com/track/60YvUB0fCvLlTDCc99wpgD?si=5f3c0edf44fd4713</a>)
for the regular dogs playlist, clocked at 204 BPM. When listening it’s
apparently wrong. It’s a piano-only piece of music with clearly some
rubato-syle tempo changes.</p>

<hr />
<p>it’s difficult to assess any tempo-related aspects of this song, not
least because (and this I know from the research that I looked at) the
song Weightless is intendedly designed to start at 70 BPM and then
-after some 5 minutes- slows down towards 60 BPM.</p>

<p>Just for fun I had a look at a song from a favorite Techno DJ of
mine, Joris Voorn. The song is Polydub from album Four: <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7fqAVya5281BFkUokiXAAB?si=44ac45f5d6a94528"
class="uri">https://open.spotify.com/track/7fqAVya5281BFkUokiXAAB?si=44ac45f5d6a94528</a></p>
<p>As can been seen very clearly: a typical 125 BPM style song.</p>

<h3>Computational-Musicology - “It’s a dogs life”</h3>
<p>This website describes my project for the course Computational
Musicology in the third year of doing a Bachelors study Musicology at
the University of Amsterdam (with a specialization in Music Cognition).
The course deals with the use of computers as a tool for answering
musicological questions.</p>
<p>My project has initially aimed to search for music playlists on
Spotify with keywords ‘relax’, ‘relaxation’ or ‘calming’. Not only for
humans but also -specifically- for dogs. There is a large quantity of
music (artists, albums, playlists) available on Spotify with those
keywords, also for dogs (and cats, jointly our most favorite pets to
live with us, human beings).</p>
<p>I attempted to -first broadly- search, then self-assemble and
-select, qualify, compare, and (deeply) analyze music (playlists and
individual songs) on Spotify, specifically searching for
<strong>similarities</strong> and/or <strong>differences</strong> in
‘calming/relaxing music’ for humans and for dogs.</p>
<p>The interest stems from my scientific curiosity into the emotional
and behavioral effects of sounds (specifically <strong>musical</strong>
sounds in this project) for humans and animals (dogs here!) alike. Not
least because of my love for my own pet dog, Tess, a 3-year-old Toller
Retriever (see photo right here where she is alert and active -which is
great- but she needs her relax moments very much too!). Her well-being
means the world to me and if we can understand the potential calming
effects of sounds to dogs a bit better I hope this can assist in
furthering the broad animal’s well-being policies and guidelines.</p>
<p>In the next tabs to the right, graphs and texts will provide insights
into the various aspects that I dived into for this project. I hope you
find it interesting to read!</p>

<h3>Introduction to the analysis of music for this project, selected on
Spotify with keywords ‘relax(ation)’/‘calming’</h3>
<p><strong>For this project I have analysed playlists on Spotify which
are named either ‘calming’ or ‘relaxing’ or ‘relaxation’ and qualified,
selected &amp; grouped them (eventually after some further research)
fourfold as follows:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>general relaxation playlist for humans</li>
<li>general relaxation playlist for dogs</li>
<li>specific relaxation playlist for humans, based upon scientific
research</li>
<li>specific relaxation playlist for dogs, based upon (some) scientific
research</li>
</ol>
<p>(all 4 are own-made playlists)</p>
<p>The overall corpus is made from songs on many playlists that exist
for those groups. It is my working hypothesis that the first two groups
are hardly different and that a high level of anthropomorphism is
applicable =&gt; we assume that what humans define and perceive as
relaxing music will be true for dogs also and hence group 2 is based on
similar criteria/elements as for group 1.</p>
<p>Research has been done into calming/relaxing effects of music, both
for humans as for dogs. For the first group, humans, we know much more
given a broader spectrum of feedback: we have language as feedback
system whereas with dogs we are limited to behavior and bodial aspects
like blood pressure or hormone level measurements like cortisol, the
‘stress hormone’. With music for dogs, research shows that similar
aspects towards calming apply as for humans (energy, loudness, pitch,
instruments) but also differences (variety, genre, ’nature’sounds).</p>
<p>Group 3 and 4, defined on certain scientific research, may show
significant differences with groups 1 and 2 on a variety of musical
‘elements’. Also between groups 3 and 4, I wanted to analyze
similarities and -especially- search for differences. This was a key
research goal for this project.</p>
<p>All but 1 (nr 3) playlists are large, i.e. &gt; 200 songs each. Nr. 3
only contains 10 songs.</p>
<p>(’Elements” are aspects of music that Spotify allows for analysis as
described <a
href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features%3E">on
Spotify</a>) e.g. loudness, tempo or mode (major or minor)</p>
<p>It might also be that ‘true’ calming music for dogs is based on
musical elements that disqualify for humans as true music (i.e. pitches
in sounds at frequency levels unhearable for humans but hearable for
dogs. This is not in scope for this project, one reason being is that
Spotify doesn’t contain (high-pitched) sounds that are non-perceivable
for humans but that dogs CAN hear.</p>
<p>My 3d group is based upon research into the most relaxing
(i.e. anxiety reducing) songs for humans: <a
href="https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/neuroscience-says-listening-to-this-one-song-reduces-anxiety-by-up-to-65-percent.html">neuroscience
on anxiety reduction</a> with <a
href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/71mRGOhRHXZRSbQzouuFw7?si=7879ee525f3d4980">official
playlist</a>. I quote from this article “…participants listened to
different songs while researchers measured brain activity as well as
physiological states that included heart rate, blood pressure, and rate
of breathing.” The song elected as nr 1 in a top 10 of most relaxing
songs is <strong>“Weightless”</strong> by <strong>Marconi Union</strong>
(a song which will be deeply analysed in the next tabs). I further
quote: “Equally remarkable is the fact the song was actually constructed
to do so. The group that created”Weightless”, Marconi Union, did so in
collaboration with sound therapists. Its carefully arranged harmonies,
rhythms, and bass lines help slow a listener’s heart rate, reduce blood
pressure and lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol.” The group I
created for this research is an exact copy of this top 10.</p>
<p>I based my fourth group, called on Spotify “Through a Dogs Ear,
science-based supposedly” upon the following paper and the available
public playlists in Spotify labeled (published by authors of this
research). See <a
href="https://icalmpet.com/wp-content/uploads/BioAcoustic-Research-and-Development-Executive-Summary.pdf">“Through
a Dogs Ear”</a>. Also have a look at <a
href="https://www.coldnosecompanions.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Through-a-Dogs-Ear-Review.pdf">a
review of Leeds work</a> The emphasis of this research is very much on a
concept called <strong>psycho- and bioacoustics</strong> I quote:
“Psychoacoustics is the discipline that studies the perception of sound
in humans. This includes how we listen, our psychological responses, and
the physiological impact of music and sound on the human nervous system.
Bioacoustics is the study of sound in animals. It looks at how animals
communicate, as well as the positive and negative effects of sound in
their environments.”</p>
<p><strong>My expectations/assumptions about similarities and/or
differences between these 4 groups in regards to the most important
musical elements were roughly as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>on Loudness, Energy and Danceability I expected all 4 groups to
score low</li>
<li>on Tempo I expected all groups to be largely in the 60-80 BPM range
(as research shows that a musical beat that is close to our (and dogs)
heartrate is assistfull to relaxation)</li>
<li>on other elements like e.g. speechiness, instrumentalness or
acousticness I didn’t formulate specific expectations beforehand (but
was rather surprised with some differences between playlists)</li>
<li>for the playlist 4 (dogs, science-based) I expected the aspect of
‘bioacoustics’ to be largely represented in the combined Spotify
elements tempo, loudness, danceability and speechiness; it’s
near-impossible to weigh the importance of each of these aspects
although tempo seems to be a crucial element. Also I a curious to delve
into timbre aspects of the dogs, science-based playlist to see if there
are some common characteristics</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>Comparing the 4 playlist on variables tempo (x) , energy (y),
loudness (color) and danceability (size) as can be seen in the chart
left, brings up some interesting and unexpected differences. As
mentioned earlier (see Tab “Introduction…”), I expected a lot of
similarity on tempo, energy, loudness and danceability (omitting
speechiness here as variable). Much to my surprise, there are much
bigger differences than I presumed.</p>
<p>Both dogs playlists score significantly lower on energy than the 2
human playlists. Bear in mind when comparing these graphs that the y
axis (for energy) has a different scales foreach playlist which means
that the differences are even more dramatic!</p>
<p>The same applies for loudness, where the human playlists score high
(yellow) and the dogs playlists much lower (blue).</p>
<p>Tempo for humans centers around 120 BPM whereas for dogs it much more
in the 60-80 BPM range.</p>
<p>On danceability also a difference can be seen (on average the dogs
playlists have many more smaller cells) but not as big as with the other
3 variables.</p>
<p>What mostly struck me is the wide spread of the songs in the playlist
humans, science-based accross these 4 variables. As these 10 songs -
supposedly- form a top 10 of most relaxing song for humans
(specifically: to relief anxiety and stress e.g. pre-surgery) why do
they not score similarly or at least near to the nr 1. song on that
list: Weightless by Marconi Union?</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Following earlier analysis I proceeded with a few selected
songs from the 2 science-based playlists to deeper analyse other aspects
as provided by chromagrams</strong></p>
<p>This tab explains the pitch-classes structure of the song
“Weightless” from playlist 3, humans science as well from the song
“Totally Beached”, an archetypical song in the playlist 4, dogs,
science.</p>
<p>I selected the song “Weightless” by Marconi Union from group 3
(humans, science-based) upon <a
href="https://www.britishacademyofsoundtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mindlab-Report-Weightless-Radox-Spa.pdf">this
research</a> into relaxing capabilities of music to lower axciety in
humans (e.g. pre-surgery). This study concluded upon a top 10 list of
most relaxing songs, with Weightless as nr 1.</p>
<p>Weightless is -intendedly- not a very energetic or
(pitch/chords/beats/timbre) changing song, quite the opposite. When
listening to it, I can hear the change to emphasis on D and A happening
after exactly 89 seconds. Some, but very little, melodic aspects then
come into play. Reason for this is, as explained by the researchers in
their study, that -when trying to have humans relax to music- they want
to minimize the brain activity related to predicting where the melody is
developing to.</p>
<p>(possibly: more explanation to follow)</p>
<p>I selected the song “Totally beached” from the fourth group (dogs,
science-based) for a further analysis because it has a strong reggae
‘vibe’ to it and <a
href="https://www.scottishspca.org/news/reggae-gets-paw-of-approval">certain
research</a> on the effect of music on calming dogs found that reggae
music (together with soft rock) is a genre preferred by dogs.</p>
<p>Totally Beached is a relative short song, where in the chromagram I
believe to see a clear reggae-style appearance of offbeat chord
elements. The song follows a classic reggae chord development between I
and IV (in this case G minor and C minor). What surprises me in the
chrogram is a relative small prominence of Eb, the terts in C minor. The
last 10 seconds are a fading-out stall of the applied instruments,
hanging on to a single C-dominated finale.</p>

<hr />
<p>On the left here are 2 cepstrograms, aimed at providing insights into
the different timbre aspects of music.</p>
<p>The cepstrogram on ‘Weightless’, the song elected as most relaxing
for humans shows an enormous amount of c02 timbre elements, meaning a
high level of brightness. (more analysis to follow)</p>
<p>For the second cepstrogram: first indications make me think that
flatness is indeed high in Totally Beached (the song for dogs based on
science). Also a relative high level of c04 which could relate to the
relative sharp ‘attack’ style of the strumming guitar with reggae. (more
analysis to follow)</p>

<p>As most songs from all 4 playlists are -intendedly- not very
‘exciting’ in terms of a lot of musical elements (and their possible
changes during a song) like tempo, energy, instrumentalness, etc. I
decided to pick an outlier from playlist 3 (humansscience) which scores
highest on tempo and relatively high on energy: Strawberry Swing by
Coldplay, to see what happens chords-wise. A chordagram is presented
here.</p>
<p>The song is in Ab (as tonica I) with mostly changes to IV (Db) and V
(Eb). This is a rather ‘normal’ chords progression. The black spot
around 95 seconds in Db appears to me the emphasis/power on Db (as
‘tension’ dominant to Ab) just before ‘releasing’ to tonica Ab
(‘home’/stability). The same ‘returned home’ energy on Ab can been seen
in the last 80 seconds of the song. As G# enharmonically is the same as
Ab, it is no surprise that there’s relative a lot of energy in there
too. There’s also a prominance to be seen in seventh chords, a usual
patterns in chordagrams as explained by our lector: ‘leakage’ of energy
in the 7th ‘bin’ (close to the 1st tonica) plays a role here
sometimes).</p>

<p>KEY ANALYSIS</p>
<p>A remarkable (in my opinion) similarity on keys between the groups,
the mean in 3 out of 4 groups on key 5, which is F. Only “humansscience”
has F# as mean. I find it very remarkable that the key of C (nr. 1), one
would expect an often used key, is completely missing in these boxplots.
Further to be analysed.</p>
<p>Analysis on chordograms to follow HERE:</p>
<p>As expected, an emphasis on I, IV and V prominence for a song in Ab.
Interesting:a lot of dark blue in C# (enharmonically the same as Db).
With knowledge of Western chords and their relationships (tonica,
subdominant, dominant and others) I expected that the software would
‘know’ - in the context of this piece of music; circle of fifths!- that
Db strongly ‘belongs’ to Ab and C# not really.</p>
<p>ON CEPSTOGRAMS:</p>
<p>At first sight, no c02 or c03 scores for the humans science groups,
that’s…remarkable. A handicap of this comparison is that the playlist
human science only contains 10 songs. But still, the absence of c02 and
c03 is remarkable. In the next tab I will analyse two larger groups,
dogs and dogs science.</p>
<p>No major differences are to be seen here between these 2 groups in
terms of Timbres except perhaps that categories c06-c10 produces higher
scores for Dogs Science.</p>
<p>LOUDNESS COMPARISON: well, at least produced a graph….now for some
analysis…:)</p>

<h3>Concluding remarks</h3>
<p><img src="images/dogearphone.jpg" style="width:14cm" /></p>
<hr />
<p>DRAFT, bulletpoint like remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>dogs playlist more strictly based on criteria for ‘true’
relaxation (e.g. tempo around 60-80; low energy); the definition for
humans relaxation seems, even for the science-based list, more loosely
formulated</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t see the aspect of variation in the playlist dogs,
science-based whereas this is mentioned in research as an important
aspect for the desired effect (calming of dogs)</p></li>
<li><p>the Spotify API doesn’t fully work flawlessly, some musical
elements are clearly wrong analysis and put in a data figure. Which
means: listen often to the songs!</p></li>
<li><p>the playlist humans science is based on a scientifically selected
set of 10 most relaxing songs (with the aim of anxiety relief,
e.g. pre-surgery). Yet, I find this list in terms of musical aspects
like e.g. tempo, energy and speechiness not very well suited for true
relaxation; I believe the definition of ‘relaxation’ for this group, as
well as for the general playlist humans is less strict than the
definition for the 2 playlists for dogs. The latter 2 are more strictly
designed to calm (in terms of heartrate, blood pressure, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>the bioacoustic aspects that research (partly leading to my 4th
group dogs scientific) into calming effects of sounds to dogs have not
been analysed. Spotify doesn’t provide Nor does Spotify generate music
above (but IN for dogs) the hearing frequency spectrum for
humans</p></li>
<li><p>the aspect of variations in music for dogs, to counter boredom,
as described in [this research] as an important factor</p></li>
</ul>
